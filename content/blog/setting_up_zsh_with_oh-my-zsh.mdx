## Supported Installation

This installation procedure is tested on Ubuntu `22.04.x LTS` with `x86_64 architecture`, but should be compatible with other Linux distributions and macOS.

# Installation

## Install dependencies
```bash
sudo apt install vim curl git
```
It's recommended to install Nerd Font in this step to avoid display problems.  
If Nerd Font isn't properly installed, you will not be able to experience the full functionality of Powerlevel10k.  

1. Install dependencies:
   - `sudo apt install fontconfig`
2. Download and install one of the nerd font:
   - MesloLGS Nerd Font
      - [Regular](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Regular.ttf)
      - [Bold](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Bold.ttf)
      - [Italic](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Italic.ttf)
      - [Bold Italic](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Bold%20Italic.ttf)
   - Fira Code Nerd Font
      - [Regular](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/raw/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode/Regular/FiraCodeNerdFont-Regular.ttf)
      - [Bold](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/raw/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode/Bold/FiraCodeNerdFont-Bold.ttf)
3. Install fonts:
   - Move all fonts to `/usr/local/share/fonts/TTF`
   - If the directory doesn't exist, create one
   - Rebuild the font cache with `fc-cache -f -v`

## Install Zsh
```bash
sudo apt install zsh
```

## Set Zsh as default shell
```bash
sudo chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

## Install On My Zsh
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## Install Powerlevel10k
```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
```
Switch the theme to Powerlevel10k by editing the config file which located in `/home/$USER/.zshrc` (`~/.zshrc`).  
Change the line `ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"` to `ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"`.

Apply the changes by executing `source /home/$USER/.zshrc` (`source ~/.zshrc`).

The Powerlevel10k configuration wizard should be started automatically.  
If it doesn't, execute `p10k configure` to start the configuration wizard.  
Choose your favorites configuration!

My personal favorite configs are: `3121132342221y1y` (Start from "Prompt Style")

## Install plugins (Optional)
***[Zsh-Completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions)***  
Additional completion definitions for Zsh.  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-${ZSH:-~/.oh-my-zsh}/custom}/plugins/zsh-completions
```

***[Zsh-Autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)***  
It suggests commands as you type based on history and completions.  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```

***[Zsh-Syntax-Highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)***  
It enables highlighting of commands whilst they are typed at a zsh prompt into an interactive terminal.  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

Finally, add the following configuration to `.zshrc`:
```bash
plugins=(
  git
  zsh-completions 
  zsh-autosuggestions 
  zsh-syntax-highlighting
)
```
Apply the changes by executing `source /home/$USER/.zshrc` (`source ~/.zshrc`).

# Finishing
Enjoy your perfect terminal with fantastic looking, autosuggestions and syntax-highlighting~

# Little tip

## Fix prompt at the bottom
Add the following lines to the end of `.zshrc` file to anchor the prompt to the bottom of the terminal window.
```bash
alias _clear=$(which clear)
clear() {
  _clear
  printf '\n%.0s' {1..$(($(tput lines) - 2))}
}
printf '\n%.0s' {1..$(($(tput lines) - 2))}
```
> The original "clear" command is now called `_clear`.

## Warp terminal patch
If you are using Warp terminal with powerlevel10k multi-line prompt, you may face the issue of the prompt and input on different lines.
![](https://i.ibb.co/sRCr1Yy/image.png)

To fix the issue, create a seperate configuration file that uses powerlevel10k one-line prompt at home directory and name it `.p10k-warp.zsh`.

Finally, replace the line `[[ ! -f ~/.p10k.zsh ]] || source ~/.p10k.zsh` in `.zshrc` with the following one.
```bash title=".zshrc"
if [[ $(printenv | grep WARP) ]];
then
	[[ ! -f ~/.p10k-warp.zsh ]] || source ~/.p10k-warp.zsh
else
	[[ ! -f ~/.p10k.zsh ]] || source ~/.p10k.zsh
fi
```

Don't forget to run `source ~/.zshrc` to apply the changes.
