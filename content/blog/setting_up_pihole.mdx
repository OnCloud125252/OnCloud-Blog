# Before Starting

## Supported Installation

This installation procedure is tested on Ubuntu 22.04.x LTS and x86_64 architecture.

## Required Dependencies

- [Docker](/blog/docker/installing_docker_and_docker_compose#install-docker)
- [Docker Compose](/blog/docker/installing_docker_and_docker_compose#install-docker-compose-plugin)

# Installation

## Install Pi-hole
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:
```yml title="docker-compose.yml"
version: "3"

# More info at https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/ and https://docs.pi-hole.net/
services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    # For DHCP it is recommended to remove these ports and instead add: network_mode: "host"
    ports:
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "67:67/udp" # Only required if you are using Pi-hole as your DHCP server
      - "80:80/tcp"
    environment:
      TZ: 'America/Chicago'
      # WEBPASSWORD: 'set a secure password here or it will be random'
    # Volumes store your data between container upgrades
    volumes:
      - './etc-pihole:/etc/pihole'
      - './etc-dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d'
    #   https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole#note-on-capabilities
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN # Required if you are using Pi-hole as your DHCP server, else not needed
    restart: unless-stopped
```
[*Official `docker-compose.yml` example*](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/blob/master/examples/docker-compose.yml.example)

## Disable default DNS resolver

Modern releases of Ubuntu include a caching DNS stub resolver by default.  
To disable this, run the following command:
```zsh
sudo sed -r -i.orig 's/#?DNSStubListener=yes/DNSStubListener=no/g' /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
```

After that, change the nameserver settings to point to "systemd-resolved":
```zsh
sudo sh -c 'rm /etc/resolv.conf && ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf'
```

Run the following command to apply the changes:
```zsh
systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

# Finishing

Now that you've set up Pi-hole, you can log in using the `WEBPASSWORD` by opening your browser and go to `http://localhost/admin`.
