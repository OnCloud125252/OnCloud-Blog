# Before Starting

## Supported Installation

This installation procedure is tested on Ubuntu 22.04.x LTS and x86_64 architecture.

# Installation

## Install Docker

To configure the MTU properly, use Docker from `apt` instead of `snap`.  
If you have already installed Docker through the system installation, remove the snap version of Docker first. Otherwise, skip this step.

Remove snap version of Docker:

```bash
sudo snap remove docker
```

Remove old versions of Docker and Docker Compose Plugin:

```bash
for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; do sudo apt remove -y $pkg; done
```

Remove old versions and install latest version of Docker and Docker Compose Plugin (New Version, Recommended)

```bash
wget -qO- https://short.on-cloud.tw/docker-installation-script | sudo bash
```

Install Docker (Old Version, Not Recommended)

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io
```

> You may test the installation by running:
>
> ```zsh
> docker --version
> ```

## Fixing Docker permission error (Otional)

If you encounter a permission error like the following when executing `docker` commands:

```
Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/containers/json": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied
```

You can either run `docker` commands with `sudo`, or enable a non-root user to access the `docker` command by following these steps:

1. Create the `docker` group on the system:
   ```bash
   sudo groupadd -f docker
   ```
2. Add the active user to the `docker` group:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```
3. Apply the group changes to the current terminal session:
   ```bash
   newgrp docker
   ```
4. Check if the `docker` group is in the list of user groups.
   ```bash
   groups
   ```
   The group should appear in the command output.

   > You should now be able to issue Docker commands as a non-root user without using `sudo`.

## Install Docker Compose Plugin (Old Version, Not Recommended)

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. It appears as a plugin for Docker.  
You won't be required to install Docker Compose in order to use Docker, but it is recommended.

Download and install the Compose CLI plugin:

```zsh
DOCKER_CONFIG=${DOCKER_CONFIG:-$HOME/.docker}

mkdir -p $DOCKER_CONFIG/cli-plugins

curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o $DOCKER_CONFIG/cli-plugins/docker-compose
```

Apply executable permissions to the binary:

```zsh
chmod +x $DOCKER_CONFIG/cli-plugins/docker-compose
```

> You may test the installation by running:
>
> ```zsh
> docker compose version
> ```

## Fixing Docker MTU issue (Otional)

To specify/override the MTU for Docker, add a parameter to the Docker launch script. The file to edit is `/lib/systemd/system/docker.service`.

If you're unsure which is the correct file, you can find it using the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```

Look for the line that starts with `Loaded:` and find the path after `loaded`. This is the file you're looking for.

To change the MTU setting (for example, to 1400), modify the line in `/lib/systemd/system/docker.service` from:

```
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock
```

to:

```
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd --mtu 1400 -H fd:// --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock
```

If you're using `docker-compose` to launch your instances, you also need to change some configuration to ensure they launch with the specified MTU.

Your Docker Compose file should include the following section:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
networks:
  default:
    driver: bridge
    driver_opts:
      com.docker.network.driver.mtu: 1400
```

After making these changes, restart Docker to apply the new MTU setting:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo service docker restart
```

# Little tip

## Stop all container

If you run into docker start issue, please refer to the following command for solution.

```zsh
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
```

## List the mounted volumes of a container

```zsh
docker inspect -f '{{ .Mounts }}' [container name/id] | python -m json.tool
```

## Start Docker Daemon

If you run into the error `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is 'docker daemon' running on this host?` when trying to run Docker commands, you can try restarting the Docker daemon using the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```
